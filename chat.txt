All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Ministry of Education and CyberPeace Foundation have joined hands to train five lakh students in India on cybersecurity skills in one academic year (2021-22). The project is planned to address the demand for skilled people in the cybersecurity sector. The aim of the programme is also to address the issues that have come up such as cybercrimes, harassment, and abuse with the technological advancements and to build a secure ecosystem of global communities where the internet will become the strength for the youth of the country. The coalition will also be researching the problems faced online and developing innovative solutions to address these problems in addition to enabling the youth to expand their knowledge and skills on the Internet.

Technology has added a lot of value to our lives. Even though the past few months, which have affected the world in ways that we couldn’t have imagined, technology has given us many opportunities to keep moving forward and stay connected. With these great opportunities, also come unprecedented risks, that many are unaware of. It has been predicted that there will be a deficit of 3.5 million cyber security professionals in the next few years. The cyber security domain has been gaining popularity, however, there is still a gap when it comes to professionals.

To impart skills and help make the upcoming tech professionals industry ready, AICTE in collaboration with the CyberPeace Foundation (www.cyberpeace.org), has undertaken Project eSaksham. The project comprises four levels of training, rated basic to advance, aimed at creating awareness, while building capacities to create a team of highly skilled professionals in the information security domain. The brochure has also been attached for your perusal.

We invite you to be part of Level 1 training which is being conducted over the next few months. The session has been planned for every Wednesday from 10 AM to 12 PM. After the session, an online assessment test will be conducted. All students participating in the assessment will be receiving participation certificates.

We are happy to inform that, Coding Ninjas is one of the largest online EdTech coding platforms that has gained recognition as one of the leaders in upskilling students by getting them placed with high package jobs in top product-based companies.
Coding Ninjas in collaboration and supported by AICTE, Chandigarh University is keen to embody the central government’s vision of National Education Policy 2020. The policy which encourage every student to learn programming, not only helps young minds develop a keen sense of logic but also proves to be a skill that they can leverage at any point in their careers. The future of the country lies in the cutting edge technologies like web 3.0, Metaverse, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence etc. that makes a strong foundation in technical education all the more imperative.
On the advent of the 75th independence of India, Coding Ninjas has entered into Amrit Kaal, Coding Ninjas joined hands with Chandigarh University to celebrate “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav”. On this note, Coding Ninjas proposes to organize the largest and one of its kind, pan India Programming Championship for all Engineering students across the country. This will not only prove to be a platform which facilitates skill based programming culture but will also prove to be an opportunity for every student who is skilled and needs a chance to showcase their potential.
The proposed programming championship will be open for all the engineering students across the country. It will be held online at Coding Ninjas Online Coding Portal across India and participants have to join through their respective Nodal centres. It is going to be a 3 staged competition which will be hosted on Coding Ninjas Platform in an online mode.
The tentative date for the competition is 1st week of June to 1st week of August 2022. For more information, candidate may access through the link https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/contests/iicc-innovate-india-coding-championship-round-1 (Facing any kind of issues, please reach out at parikh@codingninjas.com)

*Those students who have failed in any of the course/s, need not worry.* 
Following points are provided *only as a guidance to the students* and will prove helpful to the students:
1. If you are confident about your performance in the ESE, then you have the opportunity to apply for revaluation.
(Since there is a separate evaluator, there is a possibility of marks reduction also. So, if confident, then only apply for revaluation.)
2. After revaluation, there is re-revaluation process.
3. Check whether you are eligible for Grace Marks or condonation facility by going through the rule book (available on website). This can be checked by you  carefully even before applying for revaluation. 
4. If none of the above works for you, then also don't worry. Start preparing the failed courses for the Re-exam-Summer-2022, which will be held tentatively after 20-25 days from now.

Some students are not reading the autonomy rule book properly and are sending email that their grades are wrong, by referring the absolute grading table. 
It is clearly mentioned in the rules that *absolute grading is applicable only in the case of less than 15 students appearing in that course*. In all the other cases, the grading is done using relative grading method (also explained in the autonomy rule book).
It is hereby informed to all the students that the relative grading computation is done by MIS  software properly and has been further checked by the grade moderation committee of the respective department.

Greetings from AICTE

Cyber Security is a serious system engineering problem and it needs engineered solutions. This is a crisis situation and the world needs a serious intervention to create millions of cyber defenders with deep system engineering skills.

Shortages in the Cyber Défense Engineering Talent pool are causing an uncontrollable torrent of cyber-attacks the world over with no respite. Lt. Gen (Dr.) Rajesh Pañt, National Cyber Security Co-Ordinator and Special Secretary to Govt of India recently opined that India needs over 1 million trained Cyber Rakshak right away and over 2.5 million Cyber Rakshak by 2025 to get the major share of USD 100 Billion global market opportunity in the next 10 years.

As per Michael Page, the world’s largest human resource consulting firm, there are around 3.1 million unfilled cyber security jobs worldwide today. If India/Bharat wants to bring true Cyber Resilience, we need to steer through a journey of talent creation in Cyber Engineering. A good surplus of Cyber Rakshak talent pool can bridge the talent gap and support the world economy.

Looking to the "Spate of cyber-attack and opportunity unlimited in Cyber Defence for Job", the time is opportune to Mentor 500000+ budding talents in the Next-generation Cyber Defence syllabus and ignite their minds for the Cyber Défense Engineering journey.

Considering the gravity of skill shortages, AICTE has partnered with Cybervidyapeeth Foundation, an educational entity dedicated to Cyber Defense, to provide Free 200 hours of intensive free cyber–Engineering Skill Building on the "Cyber Offensive - Defence Engineering using the “Virulent Python" program from 1st September’ 2022.

Accordingly, we request you to exhort 3rd/4th-year Students & Just passed out students who are yet to get a job for registering for this unique program. We are targeting around 10000 students for the first batch from any engineering streams who are passionate about real-world Cyber battles. Admission is based on a first come first serve basis.

Students can register online at:
https://cybervidyapeeth.in/training/cyber-rakshak-beginner/

The Program 

Online Training in Cyber Offensive-Defense
Registration starts on 21st August
Online Class Starts on 01st September’2022
Target Students: BCA, BTECH, MTECH, MCA
The necessary Program brochure is enclosed herewith for your reference.

For any other clarifications, feel free to contact shashank@cybervidyapeeth.in; mentor@cybervidyapeeth.in.

1/11/23, 2:04 PM - Ajay: Dear All (TY and Final Year),
It is observed that many students of TY and Final years are paid the fees, but not updated or not deposited payment proof/receipt to the Office.
All are informed to submit it at earliest so that the record will be updated.

Also around 40-50 TY and Final Year students are still not paid the fees and taking undue advantage of institute policy which were in force due to pandamic and other anvaidable reason. Such students should clear the dues at earliest to avoid further inconvenience.

Note that, the fees paid after March 15, will not reflect in financial year and such students may face difficulty at the time of No Dues.
